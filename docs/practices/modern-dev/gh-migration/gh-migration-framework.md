# GitHub Migration Framework
## 1. __Overview__

   The __GitHub Migration Framework__ provides a structured approach for migrating from existing DevOps toolchains to GitHub, ensuring smooth execution, risk mitigation, and alignment with organizational goals. This framework exclusively utilizes __Microsoft and GitHub-related products__, including __Office 365 and GitHub (Repos, Projects, Issues, Discussions, Actions, etc.)__.

## 2. __Migration Project Management Components__   

### a. Project Flow
1. Initiation
    * Define objectives, success criteria, and scope.
    * Identify key stakeholders and assigne roles.
    * Conduct initial discovery and inventory collection.
1. Planning
     * Develop a __migration backlog__ with prioritized tasks.
     * Define the __migration cadence (sprint-based, phased, or big bang).
     * Align with business priorities and define a risk mitigation plan
1. Execution (Dry Run & Production Migration)
     * Assign work items to team members.
     * Conduct iterative migrations (test, refine, and execute).
     * Validate CI/CD, security, and governance configurations.
1. Post-Migration & Closeout
     * Conduct __post-migration analysis__ and implement improvements.
     * Validate operational success with __health checks__.
     * Conduct __final documentation and knowledge transfer__.

## 3. __Migration Backlog Management__ 
__Backlog Categories__
1. __Pre-Migration Tasks__
     * Inventory collection (Repositories, Pipelines, Policies, etc.)
     * Access & authentication setup (PATs, SSO, OAuth)
     * Risk assessment & mitigation planning

1. __Dry Run Tasks__
     * Asset migration testing
     * Validation and issue logging
     * Documentation of dry-run results

1. Production Migration Tasks
     * Execute final migrations
     * Post-migration validation and fixes
     * Ensure CI/CD pipelines, security rules, and access controls are intact

1. Post-Migration Tasks
     * Developer onboarding and training
     * Retrospective and documentation
     * Continuous monitoring setup (DORA metrics, GitHub Insights)

 ### **Backlog Prioritization Criteria**
* Business impact
* Technical complexity
* Risk level
* Dependencies between assets

## 4. Team Cadence & Governance

### **Team Structure** 
* __Migration Lead:__ Oversees the entire migration process.
* __Technical Migration Engineers:__ Execute repository, CI/CD, and security migrations.
* __Product Owners / Stakeholders:__ Define requirements and validate outcomes.
* __Project Manager:__ Ensures project tracking, backlog prioritization, and risk mitigation.

### __Cadence__
  * __Daily Standups (15 min):__ Track progress, blockers, and adjustments.
  * __Weekly Migration Review (60 min):__ Assess backlog progress, validate dry-run outcomes.
  * __Stakeholder Sync (Bi-weekly/As needed):__ Align with business leaders and ensure priorities are met.
  * __Post-Migration Retrospective:__ Identify improvements for future migrations.

## 5. Artifacts & Templates


| **Artifact** |	**Purpose** |	**Format**	| 
|--------------|-------------|------------|
|**Inventory Collection** |	Tracks existing assets and dependencies.	| Excel (Office 365 - Attached)	|
|**Migration Plan** |	Outlines strategy, risk assessment, and execution details.	| Excel (Office 365 - Attached)	
|**Migration Backlog** |	Tracks all migration tasks and prioritization.	| GitHub Projects	
|**Project Status Reports** |	Periodic reports for leadership and stakeholders.	| Word/Excel (Office 365)	
|**Issue Tracking Document** |	Logs migration issues and resolutions.	| GitHub Issues	
|**Post-Migration Health Check** |	Ensures all repositories, pipelines, and security settings are intact.	| Markdown (GitHub Repo)	


## 6. Integration with GitHub Project Tools
For migration execution and tracking, use __GitHub Projects:__
* Kanban Board for Backlog Management
* Issue Tracking for Migration Blockers
* Pull Requests for Automated Migration Validations
* GitHub Actions for CI/CD Post-Migration Validation

## 7. Migration Execution Phases

a. Pre-Migration Phase
* Assessment & Planning
  * Inventory all repositories, pipelines, users, permissions, policies, integrations.
  * Define the scope and prioritize migration.
  * Plan for governance, compliance, and security configurations.
* Generate Access & Tokens
  * Set up authentication (SSO, PATs, OAuth).
  * Establish required security policies.

b. Dry-Run Phase
* Discovery & Pre-Migration Analysis
  * Map existing assets to GitHub equivalents.
  * Identify compatibility issues.
* Dry-Run Execution
  * Perform a test migration and verify integrity.
  * Validate CI/CD, secrets, and access control.
* Dry-Run Analysis
  * Document findings and refine migration plans.

c. Production Migration Phase
* Production Planning
  * Apply lessons from dry-run testing.
  * Define final cutover strategy.
* Production Execution
  * Migrate assets and validate functionality.
* Post-Migration Analysis
  * Conduct health checks and confirm success metrics.

d. Engagement Closeout
* Provide final documentation.
* Train developers and administrators on the new GitHub setup.
* Transition ongoing management to operational teams.

## 8. Next Steps
1. __Refine the backlog structure__ for better prioritization.
2. __Define granular checklists__ for each migration phase.
3. **Validate team cadence with real migration execution.
4. __Develop detailed artifacts and templates__ for use within GitHub repositories.

## 9. Migration Program Rollout
