 # GitHub Migration Framework
## 1. __Overview__

   The __GitHub Migration Framework__ provides a structured approach for migrating from existing DevOps toolchains to GitHub, ensuring smooth execution, risk mitigation, and alignment with organizational goals. This framework exclusively utilizes __Microsoft and GitHub-related products__, including __Office 365 and GitHub (Repos, Projects, Issues, Discussions, Actions, etc.)__.

## 2. __Migration Project Management Components__   

### a. Project Flow
1. Initiation
     * Define objectives, success criteria, and scope.
     * Identify key stakeholders and assigne roles.
     * Conduct initial discovery and inventory collection.
1. Planning
     * Develop a __migration backlog__ with prioritized tasks.
     * Define the __migration cadence (sprint-based, phased, or big bang).
     * Align with business priorities and define a risk mitigation plan
1. Execution (Dry Run & Production Migration)
     * Assign work items to team members.
     * Conduct iterative migrations (test, refine, and execute).
     * Validate CI/CD, security, and governance configurations.
1. Post-Migration & Closeout
     * Conduct __post-migration analysis__ and implement improvements.
     * Validate operational success with __health checks__.
     * Conduct __final documentation and knowledge transfer__.

## 3. __Migration Backlog Management__ 
Backlog Categories
Pre-Migration Tasks
Inventory collection (Repositories, Pipelines, Policies, etc.)
Access & authentication setup (PATs, SSO, OAuth)
Risk assessment & mitigation planning

Dry Run Tasks
Asset migration testing
Validation and issue logging
Documentation of dry-run results

Production Migration Tasks
Execute final migrations
Post-migration validation and fixes
Ensure CI/CD pipelines, security rules, and access controls are intact

Post-Migration Tasks
Developer onboarding and training
Retrospective and documentation
Continuous monitoring setup (DORA metrics, GitHub Insights)

Backlog Prioritization Criteria
Business impact
Technical complexity
Risk level
Dependencies between assets

## 4. Team Cadence & Governance

Team Structure
Migration Lead: Oversees the entire migration process.
Technical Migration Engineers: Execute repository, CI/CD, and security migrations.
Product Owners / Stakeholders: Define requirements and validate outcomes.
Project Manager: Ensures project tracking, backlog prioritization, and risk mitigation.

Cadence
Daily Standups (15 min): Track progress, blockers, and adjustments.
Weekly Migration Review (60 min): Assess backlog progress, validate dry-run outcomes.
Stakeholder Sync (Bi-weekly/As needed): Align with business leaders and ensure priorities are met.
Post-Migration Retrospective: Identify improvements for future migrations.

## 5. Artifacts & Templates


**Artifact**	**Purpose**	**Format**	
**Inventory Collection**	Tracks existing assets and dependencies.	Excel (Office 365 - Attached)	
**Migration Plan**	Outlines strategy, risk assessment, and execution details.	Excel (Office 365 - Attached)	
**Migration Backlog**	Tracks all migration tasks and prioritization.	GitHub Projects	
**Project Status Reports**	Periodic reports for leadership and stakeholders.	Word/Excel (Office 365)	
**Issue Tracking Document**	Logs migration issues and resolutions.	GitHub Issues	
**Post-Migration Health Check**	Ensures all repositories, pipelines, and security settings are intact.	Markdown (GitHub Repo)	


## 6. Integration with GitHub Project Tools
For migration execution and tracking, use GitHub Projects:
Kanban Board for Backlog Management
Issue Tracking for Migration Blockers
Pull Requests for Automated Migration Validations
GitHub Actions for CI/CD Post-Migration Validation

## 7. Migration Execution Phases

a. Pre-Migration Phase
Assessment & Planning
Inventory all repositories, pipelines, users, permissions, policies, integrations.
Define the scope and prioritize migration.
Plan for governance, compliance, and security configurations.
Generate Access & Tokens
Set up authentication (SSO, PATs, OAuth).
Establish required security policies.

b. Dry-Run Phase
Discovery & Pre-Migration Analysis
Map existing assets to GitHub equivalents.
Identify compatibility issues.
Dry-Run Execution
Perform a test migration and verify integrity.
Validate CI/CD, secrets, and access control.
Dry-Run Analysis
Document findings and refine migration plans.

c. Production Migration Phase
Production Planning
Apply lessons from dry-run testing.
Define final cutover strategy.
Production Execution
Migrate assets and validate functionality.
Post-Migration Analysis
Conduct health checks and confirm success metrics.

d. Engagement Closeout
Provide final documentation.
Train developers and administrators on the new GitHub setup.
Transition ongoing management to operational teams.

## 8. Next Steps
Refine the backlog structure for better prioritization.
Define granular checklists for each migration phase.
**Validate team cadence with real migration execution.
Develop detailed artifacts and templates for use within GitHub repositories.

## 9. Migration Program Rollout
